# Privacy Policy for Zakat Pro

**Last Updated: February 02, 2026**

## 1. Introduction
Welcome to **Zakat Pro**. We value your privacy and are committed to protecting any information you may provide while using our Service. This application is designed with a **"Privacy First"** approach. The Service is provided "as-is," and we ensure that your spiritual and financial data remains entirely under your control.

## 2. Information Collection and Use
We believe in absolute data privacy.

### A. Automatic Data Collection
**Zakat Pro** does **NOT** automatically collect, store, or share any Personal Identifiable Information (PII) or sensitive user data. This includes, but is not limited to:
* Name, Phone Number, or Address.
* Precise or coarse Location Data.
* Device Identifiers (IMEI, Android ID, etc.).
* Contact lists or personal photos.

All Zakat calculations, asset details, and distribution records are processed and stored **locally on your device**. No data is sent to our servers.

### B. In-App Donations (Google Play Billing)
The app offers an optional donation feature to support the project.
* All financial transactions are handled securely by **Google Play Billing**.
* We **do not** collect or store your credit card numbers, bank account details, or any other financial credentials.
* Google provides us only with a confirmation of the purchase to fulfill the donation request.

### C. Voluntary Communication (Contact Support)
If you choose to contact us via email for support, feedback, or suggestions, we will receive your email address and the content of your message.
* This action is strictly voluntary and initiated by you.
* We use your email address solely for the purpose of replying to your query.
* We do not store your email in any marketing database or share it with third parties.

## 3. Local Data Storage & Permissions
To provide a premium offline experience, the app stores certain data locally on your device (using **Room Database** & **SharedPreferences**). This includes:
* **Zakat History:** Past calculation records and dates.
* **Zakat Diary:** Personal logs of to whom and when Zakat was distributed.
* **Preferences:** Custom Nisab prices (Gold/Silver), currency symbols, and theme settings.
* **Storage Access:** The app requires storage permission strictly to save and export the **PDF Report** of your calculations to your device when you choose to do so.

**Note:** This data is stored strictly within the app's private directory on your device. We do not have access to this data, and it is never transmitted to any third party.

## 4. Offline Functionality & Third-Party Services
**Zakat Pro** is designed as an offline-first application.
* **No Internet Required:** The core functions of calculating Zakat, managing history, and reading Islamic rules do NOT require an active internet connection.
* **No Third-Party Tracking:** We do not use third-party analytics (like Google Analytics), advertising SDKs, or any tracking pixels.
* **Limited Connectivity:** Internet is only required for the In-App Donation process via Google Play Store.

## 5. Data Security
Since we do not collect or transmit your sensitive Zakat data over the internet, your information is safe from remote hacking or server-side data breaches. The security of your data depends on the security of your physical device.

## 6. User Control & Data Deletion
You have total control over your data:
* **Clearing Data:** You can reset all saved settings and history by going to your device's **Settings > Apps > Zakat Pro > Storage > Clear Data**.
* **Uninstalling:** Uninstalling the app will automatically and permanently delete all locally stored calculation history, settings, and diary entries.

## 7. Children’s Privacy
Our Service does not target anyone under the age of 13. Since we do not collect any personal information, the app is compliant with global privacy regulations (COPPA/GDPR). It is safe for users of all ages.

## 8. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in the app's features. We will notify you of any changes by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this page.
